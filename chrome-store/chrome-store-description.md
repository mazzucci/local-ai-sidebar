What Local AI Sidebar Does

Local AI Sidebar brings powerful AI capabilities directly to your browser using Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano model. All processing happens locally on your device - your content never leaves your computer.

Key Features:
• Simple chat interface for direct AI interaction
• Manual paste analysis - copy text and paste for analysis
• Custom prompt library for specific tasks
• Centralized conversation history with "New Chat" option
• Real-time download progress with splash screen
• Complete offline operation after initial download

Why Install It

Most AI tools require sending sensitive content to external servers. Users constantly switch between web pages and AI tools, breaking their workflow and requiring copy-paste between tabs.

Current AI solutions have significant barriers:
• Expensive subscriptions and complex API setups
• Heavy desktop installations that consume system resources
• Monthly fees, rate limits, and complex configuration requirements

Local AI Sidebar solves these problems by providing AI assistance that:
• Never sends your data anywhere - everything processes locally
• Requires no accounts, subscriptions, or API keys
• Works completely offline after initial download
• Integrates seamlessly into your browser workflow

How It Works

Setup is incredibly simple:
• Install with no registration required
• Click extension icon to open AI sidebar
• AI model downloads automatically on first use
• Start using AI assistance immediately

The extension uses Chrome's built-in Prompt API to access the Gemini Nano AI model locally. When you ask questions or paste content, everything processes locally without internet connection or data transmission.

Requirements:
• Chrome version 138 or higher
• Chrome's Prompt API enabled
• One-time ~2GB model download

Important Limitations

Local AI models are experimental technology. Performance depends on your hardware capabilities:
• Response times may vary based on device processing power
• Requires significant computational resources
• Older devices may experience slower performance

For maximum privacy, consider installing on a separate Chrome profile dedicated to AI-assisted browsing.

This extension is open source and available under the MIT license. You can view the source code, modify it, or contribute improvements at the GitHub repository.
