**What Local AI Sidebar Does**

Local AI Sidebar brings powerful AI capabilities directly to your browser using Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano model. All processing happens locally on your device - your content never leaves your computer.

**Key Features:**

• **Privacy-First Chat**: You copy/paste content to analyze - AI never automatically accesses pages
• **Custom Prompts**: Create and save your own prompts for specific tasks
• **Knowledge Management**: Upload PDFs and add text documents that AI can reference when answering questions
• **Conversation History**: Maintain chat history across tabs with "New Chat" option
• **Complete Offline**: Works without internet after initial model download
• **Local Storage**: All data stored in Chrome's local storage - never synced to cloud

**Why Install It**

Most AI tools send your content to external servers, raising privacy concerns. Local AI Sidebar is different:

Traditional AI Tools:

• Require subscriptions and API keys
• Send data to external servers
• Need internet connection
• Cost money monthly

Local AI Sidebar:

• Completely free - no subscriptions
• Zero data transmission - everything stays local
• Works offline after setup
• You control what content AI sees

**How It Works**

Simple 3-step setup:

1. Install extension (no registration required)
2. Click extension icon to open sidebar
3. AI model downloads automatically (~2GB one-time download)

The extension uses Chrome's built-in Prompt API to access Gemini Nano locally. When you paste content or upload PDFs, everything processes on your device without any network calls.

**Knowledge Management (RAG)**

Go beyond simple chat - build your own knowledge base:

• **Upload PDFs**: Add documents for AI to reference
• **Import Text**: Save articles, notes, or any text content
• **Smart Search**: AI automatically finds relevant information from your knowledge base when answering
• **Private Storage**: All documents stored locally in your browser - never uploaded

Perfect for researchers, students, and professionals who want to chat with their documents privately.

**Important Notes**

Local AI models are experimental technology:

• Performance varies based on hardware capabilities
• Requires computational resources
• Responses may be slower than cloud-based AI
• Not suitable for critical decision-making without verification

**Privacy Guarantee**

• AI never automatically accesses webpage content
• You explicitly choose what to share by copying/pasting
• All data stored in Chrome local storage only
• Nothing synced to Google accounts or cloud
• Open source - verify privacy claims yourself

For maximum privacy, use a separate Chrome profile for AI-assisted browsing.

**Transform Your Browsing Experience**

Stop compromising between AI assistance and privacy. Get powerful AI with complete privacy protection - no accounts, no subscriptions, no data sharing.

**Open Source & Transparent**
